Please copy the well-trained sub-models from stage 1 to this folder. 

For example, if there are 3 sub-models, there should be 3 sub-folders here. The first directory should be named as "1" and there should be a "tf_ckpts" directory (containing the first sub-model) in the "1" folder. Following similar naming format, the second sub-model should be put in folder "2", and the third sub-model should be put in folder "3".
